# Update MASTER_TEST_HISTORY.md From Git History and Development Notes

You are working inside the repository root.

## Objective

Update:

`FM-PCC/logs_in_develop/MASTER_TEST_HISTORY.md`

This file is a chronological daily development history.

Your task is to append new history entries starting from the current end of the file. Do NOT rewrite existing history under any circumstances unless the user explicitly requests modifications to existing content. Preserve all existing content.

---

## Sources to Analyze

### 1. Git History

Inspect all commits that occurred after the latest date already recorded in `MASTER_TEST_HISTORY.md`.

For each relevant commit, collect:

* commit hash
* commit message
* commit date/time
* files changed
* summary of actual code changes (from diff, not only commit message)

Commands that may help:

```bash
git log --stat
git log --name-only
git show <commit>
git diff
```

### 2. Development Notes

Read all markdown files under:

```text
FM-PCC/logs_in_develop/
```

including nested folders if present.

Pay special attention to:

* daily notes
* testing notes
* implementation notes
* bug investigation notes
* feature planning notes
* architecture notes

Use these notes to enrich and explain the development history rather than merely listing commits.

---

## Update Requirements

### Determine Current Cutoff

First:

1. Read `MASTER_TEST_HISTORY.md`
2. Identify the latest recorded date/entry
3. Only generate history AFTER that point

Avoid duplicate entries.

---

### Create New Daily Sections

Append new sections in the same style as the existing document.

## Update Requirements

### Determine Current Cutoff

First:

1. Read `MASTER_TEST_HISTORY.md`
2. Identify the latest recorded date/entry
3. Only generate history AFTER that point

Avoid duplicate entries.

---

### Create New Daily Sections

Append new sections in the same style and structure already used in `MASTER_TEST_HISTORY.md`.

---

### Content Quality Rules

Do NOT simply copy commit messages.

Instead:

* group related commits together
* infer the actual feature work
* explain why changes were made
* summarize implementation progress
* mention important refactors
* mention testing activities
* mention failed approaches if documented in notes
* mention architectural decisions if documented

Produce a meaningful engineering narrative.

Bad:

```markdown
- Commit: fix bug
- Commit: update code
```

Good:

```markdown
- Fixed state synchronization issue in the PCC processing pipeline that caused stale test results after configuration updates.
- Refactored validation logic into reusable modules, reducing duplicated checks across multiple execution paths.
```

---

## Cross-Validation

Before writing:

1. Verify each claimed activity is supported by either:

   * git diff
   * commit history
   * development notes

2. Merge duplicate information appearing in multiple sources.

3. Prefer actual code changes over commit-message wording.

---

## Final Output

Directly modify:

```text
FM-PCC/logs_in_develop/MASTER_TEST_HISTORY.md
```

Append the new sections after the current ending section.

Do not create a new file.

Do not truncate existing content.

Maintain chronological ordering.

---

## Cleanup Requirements

After successfully updating the history file, you MUST explicitly delete any temporary files, intermediate text dumps, or processing scripts you created during your research and analysis steps to keep the workspace clean.
