# Test History

Purpose: concise record of what was tested across all generations/vresions. Master logging markdown.

## Gen1

Keywords: wrong code, reversed ODE trajectory.

1. Early FM code had reversed ODE trajectory direction.
2. Result interpretation from this phase is not trusted as final baseline.

## Gen2

Keywords: diffusion engine replacement, basic FM engine, uniform time, 20/20/20.

1. Replaced old diffusion engine with a basic FM engine.
2. Time handling used uniform time in [0,1].
3. Main setting used 20 train steps, 20 sampling steps, 20 ODE steps.

## Gen2 (U-Net v2)

Keywords: U-Net v2 build, TODO architecture change, no effective behavior change.

1. Built U-Net v2 path.
2. Structural U-Net-v2 upgrade remained TODO.
3. Net behavior change was not material in this phase.

## Gen3 Upgrade 1 Hyperparameter Tuning

Keywords: action_weight_a0 tuning, HP1=1, HP2=5.

1. Tuned FM action_weight_a0 from original 10.
2. HP1 set action_weight_a0 to 1.
3. HP2 set action_weight_a0 to 5.

## Gen3 Upgrade 2 FM-v2

Keywords: beta time, two de facto tests, ODE=10 eval change.

1. Implemented beta-time sampling in FM-v2.
2. De facto test #1: Beta-time only.
3. De facto test #2: Beta-time plus eval ODE changed to 10. (in logs it is mark with FMv2, ie. default name)
4. Test markings:
5. "Beta Time" marks beta-only test.
6. "ODE=10" marks beta-time plus eval ODE=10 test.

## Gen3 Upgrade 3 FM-v3

Keywords: SafeFlow-style time semantics, continuous-time query, flow_steps_v3.

1. Introduced v3 path with SafeFlow-style continuous-time model query semantics.
2. Added v3 config/script path and v3 parameter naming.
3. Kept v2 path intact for rollback and comparison.


## Gen 4 Visual Model for Avoiding D3IL

- **DANGER!!! Major code structure change:** The codebase has been refactored so that the D3IL library no longer needs to be cloned separately — it is now integrated directly into the FM-PCC codebase and can be imported directly.
